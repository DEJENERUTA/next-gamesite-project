							Each lifepath will begin in a different starting location in Night
							City and V will be in a different place in life overall. V will
							have a different introductory questline, and equipment which will
							be connected to your specific origin story and will be introduced
							to the characters differently. Lifepaths will stretch the entirety
							of the game, and not only will it open up different dialogue
							options like previously stated, but you will also unlock specific
							side quests based off your Lifepath.
